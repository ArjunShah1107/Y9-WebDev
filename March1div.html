<h1>Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities</h1>

<h4>By 2030, we will work on reducing inequality within and among countries. This SDG calls for reducing inequalities in income as well as those based on age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status within a country.</h4>

<h1>Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth</h1>

<h4>By 2030, we will work on increasing the amount of decent work while simultaneously increasing economic growth</h4>

<h1>Connections</h1>

<h4>By 2030, all people, no matter their age, race or any other <i> dehumanizing </i> facts will all have above decent jobs, with an above decent pay, and although more jobs means more economic downfall, hard-working people deserve to be paid, and their hard work will eventually help to increase economic growth, especially for money-making jobs in banking industries.</h4>
